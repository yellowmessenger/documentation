## Learn - Create / New

### How to create a new function? 
Cloud Functions compose of all the user defined functions that defines and controls the flow of the bot. The whole structure of writing the code is modularised. Main is the default function which is executed for every message. In the builder section, we can link the cloud functions directly in validators or steps or init functions by selecting the corresponding cloud function created in Developer section.

![how to add a new function](../img/howtos/function.png)

Another way of adding a new function is directly going to the Studio -> Code section and Add New Function as shown. 

![how to add a new function](../img/howtos/new_function.png


---------------------------------------


### How to create a new database and make changes to it? 

**Keywords** :  create , edit, upload, modify, delete, index, note on indexing issue and red symbol

`Step 1 ` : Adding a new table : You can add a new table by simply clicking on the ‚Äòcreate table‚Äô button. You can add fields here along with custom mapping of the fields if required. 

![how to add a new table](../img/howtos/new_database.png)

`Step 2 ` : Download the table and add/edit/remove any data from this table. Truncate the same table and reupload the new table. As shown in the following steps. 
Edit the table as you want and save it in CSV format. Please make sure that the headers of the table are not changed. 


`Step 3` : Truncate the table in the database and upload the new updated table. Please make sure you don‚Äôt Drop the table. Dropping the table will delete the table entirely. 

![how to download a table](../img/howtos/table_truncate.png)

Once changes are made, can upload the table in CSV format back on the same page using 'Upload' button. 


---------------------------------------


### How to Validate the response of a user? 

Validating any step is as simple as you can think, especially when the expected response from the user if name, email, mobile, location, quick replies or regex. Please regex can be defined here.

### How to add a new API?


1. Click on Studio, go to API tab. On the API tab, click on `+ Create new API` button.

![Create new API](../img/howtos/invoke_api_1.jpg)

2. Enter an API name. API names are alpha-numeric names in Camel Case and we can not have multiple APIs with the same name. The [joke API](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke) used below returns a joke with a punchline in the GET request.

![Add joke API](../img/howtos/invoke_api_2.jpg)

3. Once added, you can test the API by hitting `Send` button. If the API is correctly added and the endpoint works, you should be able to see a sample response as below. 

![API Response](../img/howtos/invoke_api_3.jpg)

4. Don't forget to click on save button on the bottom left corner, otherwise you won't get the joke. Now you may laugh! :laughing:

### How to setup did you mean? 

**Keywords** : didyoumean, suggestions

By default, when the bot is not able to understand any message, it displays a default message.
To combat this, we can generally provide custom text or quick replies.

But there is a catch, these responses are static in nature and at times is not what the user is looking for.
It is more intuitive to show some suggestions if they are very close to what the user requested or resemble something in the training of the bot.

For this, a default *didYouMean* function is being made available wherein, just by passing in the *app.prediction.intents*, it can provide you the alternative list of journeys that the bot thinks can be triggered.

>The overriding design goal for didYouMean is to make it as simple as possible to get meaningful suggestions.
The idea is that the developer shouldn‚Äôt need to re-invent the wheel and should be able to directly utilise this functionality so as to improve the user experience.

#### Where to call
The *didYouMean** function is being made available as the 2nd function in the list of functions in the Developer section of the platform.

So as not to conflict with existing functionality, it is not added as the Default Action for unidentified utterance. For this, *the developer has to go to Default Journey and add it as the response/action*.

#### Function syntax
`
app.getAlternateJourneyOptions(app.prediction.intents, 0.4, [], []).then((options) => {
    
})
// no catch required 
`

The didYouMean uses a util/helper function app.getAlternateJourneyOptions which provides the options back to the developer for further processing.

The function accepts 4 params as of now:

* app.prediction.intents -> Mandatory. To get all the intents from the prediction.

* confidence -> Optional. Confidence threshold below which the journeys are filtered out from the result. By default, 0.0 to allow all journeys to pass through. The good value will be >=0.4

* journeySlugs -> Optional. An array of journey slug names not to be included in the results.

*categoryNames -> Optional. An array of categories whose journeys will not be included in the results.

The function returns an array of objects called options that can be directly passed to app.sendQuickReplies as options.
If no journeys are present (or filtered out), then an empty array is returned.

The provision for handling both of these functions is present in the UI function.

#### The customization that can be done
In the UI, the following options can be customized:

* scripts -> The text related to didYouMean can be customized according to the requirements and personality of the bot in question.

* Agent Transfer -> If Agent Transfer is present in the bot, you can include the journey explicitly. The provision is shown in the UI under the comments itself.
* Caution - Please include the Agent Transfer journey where you pass journeySlugs so as to not show it as the option in between and most importantly to detect when didYouMean is failing.

#### FAQs
*What if I already have a didYouMean function implemented in my code?*
The didYouMean has been added in such a way that if you already have a function called didYouMean, then the function won‚Äôt be overwritten. Though we do advise to give our function a shot as additional features will be tied into the functionality.

*What if I want to add more functionality to the function?*
You are always free to customize the UI function according to your needs.
If in some cases, you feel that some features should be made available by default from the Platform side, you can always drop a message to the below-given details.

### How to do elastic search for database

#### DataStore
The datastore is the local database that is available with each bot instance. It is stored inside MongoDB and is indexed with ElasticSearch.

Each bot‚Äôs table gets it‚Äôs own index, by default. If needed, you can specify your own elasticsearch mapping to map the database as per your need.

#### Architecture
Each table in the bot gets its own space in MongoDB and gets indexed into elasticsearch.

You can use the UI to create the table, but in order to query through your code, you will need to know how to write elasticsearch queries

A good place to start would be: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/getting-started.html

#### Datastore UI
The datastore in the UI can be accessed through Developer -> Database, herewith referred to as database section in this document

Datastore API
The datastore is available inside the app library and can be accessed with app.dataStore

#### Datastore methods
* search
* insert
* update
* delete
* find
* aggregate
* updateMany
* get
* getForm
* search
The datastore search can be used to search for the record in the table
```
app.datastore.search({
    table: tableName,
    body: esQuery
})
```
*tableName*: The table name that is present in the database section

*esQuery*: The elastic search query that is to be used to search for the records

This function is promisified and hence can be chained for success and reject cases. The chain would go into the reject block in-case of any errors. It is vital to handle this part.

#### insert
The datastore insert function can be used to add records to your table
```
app.datastore.insert({
        table: tableName,
        record: recordObject
    })

```   
*tableName*: The table name that is present in the database section

*recordObject*: The Object containing the key-value pairs of the record. The keys are the column names and the values are the values for the columns. The keys have to match the exact column name present in the table

## Design - Related To BOT UI 

### Change the name,title, sub-title, description of the bot? 

ü§ì Trick : If you want to see live preview of the changes you‚Äôre making then go to your bot journeys, click on ‚ÄòTest your bot' on top right. And click on Bot Direct Link as shown here -

![how to make changes in UI](../img/howtos/name_desc.png)

You can also upload a new bot icon here. 

---------------------------------------

### Change the color schema and design of the bot? 

Creativity is intelligence having fun. Better color combinations and effective aesthetics can be a cherry on the cake, so we should make sure that these features, the color, font, etc can be matched with the clients websites and a standard template can be followed for all chatbots.  

`Step 1` : Access Chat Widget here - Login on the platform -> Open a bot -> Go to the Channels tab on the left botton-> Choose web here.

`Step 2` : Under Web here, you will see the following sections in Appearances and Settings. 

1. Bot Icon and Animations

2. Background

3. Buttons

4. Chat
    
5. Font
   
6. Header

7. Publish your bot : Use the code snippet provided there, add it to the bottom of the ‚Äòbody‚Äô tag. This should be shared with the client and can be added to their index.html page. 

![how to make changes in UI](../img/howtos/bot_ui.png)

`Step 3` : Default theme is chosen at the start, so you can create new themes and switch between the same. 

Just one more thing, don‚Äôt forget to 'Save your Settings' and your beautiful bot is good to go! üôÇ 

---------------------------------------


### How to publish a bot? 
**Keywords** : #publish, #push_bot, #take_bot_live

`Step 1` : Move bot from sandbox from staging environment. Click on the publish button at the top right of the . 

*Note* : 
1. The first push can only be done by the super admin of the bot.
2. Check the following before pushing the bot :
   1. Bot is trained
   2. Bot is tested to be moved to the further environment.  


---------------------------------------

### How to move the bot/ chat-widget position on the website? 
**Keywords** : #position, #chatWidget #bot_position

`Step 1` : Get the bot Publish Script from the platform, go to Channels > Web > Publish Bot as shown below - 
![how to make changes in UI](../img/howtos/publish.png)

`Step 1` : In the same code, near bot ID add the following - 

`{ bot: 'YOUR BOT ID',alignLeft: true }`

The final code would look something like - 

```<script type="text/javascript">
window.ymConfig = { bot: 'YOUR BOT ID',alignLeft: true };  (function () {var w=window,ic=w.YellowMessenger;if("function"===typeof ic)ic("reattach_activator"),ic("update",ymConfig);else{var d=document,i=function(){i.c(arguments)};function l(){var e=d.createElement("script");e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.src="https://app.yellowmessenger.com/widget/main.js";var t=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)}i.q=[],i.c=function(e){i.q.push(e)},w.YellowMessenger=i,w.attachEvent?w.attachEvent("onload",l):w.addEventListener("load",l,!1)}})();
    </script>
```

### How to change the font of a bot? 
Good fonts means 5 more marks for good handwriting! Haha! Let's see how we can change the font of the bot. 
This document will help in changing font for PWA/ Website Bots. 

**Keywords** : #fonts, #chatWidget #botUI 
**References** : https://fonts.google.com/

`Step 1` : Browse through the [Google fonts ](https://fonts.google.com/)link and choose your favorite style.   

![select](../img/howtos/font.png)


`Step 2` : Select a style, get the URL. URL would look something like this - https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300&display=swap   

`Step 3` : Open this link in a different tab and get the *.woff2* link from there. 
![select](../img/howtos/font-woff2.png)

`Step 4` : Now add this link to the Channels > Web > Font > Advanced > Custom Font URL

### How to add Contextual Responses? 

**Keywords** : contextual, why, what, how

Setting up contextual responses means adding more context to the response to a particular step. To simplify it further lets take an example  
**Bot** : Can you share your email with me?  
~~**User** : Sure, gooduser@email.com~~   
**Bot** : Why do you need my email?  

What if instead of giving their email address during a conversation, customer asked *What is an email* Or *Why do you need my email*. 
These type of contextual intents can be handled in the following ways :

#### First Way of Adding Contextual Responses : Adding Global Contextual Responses
Setting up standard contextual responses for all steps in all journeys in the bot. Basically if the users ask Why/What/How/ etc at any step, the response will be the same. If you want the same, please follow the following steps : 

`Step 1` : On the Yellow Messenger Platform, under Studio > Learn > Context Management as shown below. 
![contextual](../img/howtos/contextual.png)

`Step 2` : You can change or add the responses for the various predefined contextual intents like What/Why/How/When/Where/etc. 
![contextual](../img/howtos/contextual-edit.png)

`Step 3` : You can Bulk Upload and Export these intents and responses as well. 
![contextual](../img/howtos/contextual-bulk.png)

`Step 4` : In order to add new intents click on * '+ Add Contextual Responses'* 
![contextual](../img/howtos/contextual-new.png)

`Step 5` : Add as many training utterances as possible, prompts that the user can type for a particular context. 


Now when the user will ask for these questions [Why/What/How/etc] at any step during the conversation. The bot will be able to send these contexual responses to the user. 

Please note that the user is not moving ahead while user is asking contextual responses. The user will remain at the same step untill the correct response if given. 

![contextual](../img/howtos/contextual-example.png)


#### Second Way of Adding Contextual Responses : Adding Step Contextual Responses
In case you want a different contextual response at every step in the bot, please follow the given steps : 

`Step 1` : Could not find this in the new platform UI. 

`Step 2` : 


### How to setup context at any step? 

>We humans are always aware of context. Even chatbots also store the context to maintain the state of conversation.
Conversations always happen on a particular topic (like intent), and it is a chain of texts (steps) exchanged between the user and the bot. So, this context keeps the conversation flowing.

This context is stored as a JSON which is constantly updated at each and every step of a conversation. It stores all the info required to identify the state of a conversation, like the *step information* (visited steps), *intent name* (current intent) any many more.
It is available at app.context

```
app.context object
{
   "complete": true,
   "steps": {
        "mobile_num": "9999999999",
       "customer_id": "-",
        "otp": "-"
    },
    "intent": "login"
}
```
At any point, you can access this object to do things like
* getting data of the steps
* knowing the current status of the conversation ( Intent name & the number of steps visited )
* changing a step value

#### Getting data of the steps
* app.context.steps is an object which contains key-value pairs of steps and the step values (user inputs) in the format step_name: step_value
* A new step is added into app.context.steps only after the validation of that step.
* When it hits an intent, this steps object is initially empty
* 
#### Getting Intent name
* app.context.intent contains the current intent name

#### Other data
(Very limited use cases though)

* app.context.complete contains a boolean value. If it‚Äôs true then the intent is done with visiting all the steps
* app.dataHistory contains an array of most recent incoming messages to the bot 
In action function, you can make use of this app.context object to get all the required information to process the answer.

A typical action function below
```
return new Promise(resolve => {

    // Getting the data from the steps
    let otp = app.context.steps.otp
    let mobile = app.context.steps['mobile_number'] // another way of accessing data

    // API CALL which requires the above data
    // api logic here
    
    app.sendTextMessage('You have been successfully logged in')

    resolve();
});

```

This object is always updated for every intent. When it hits another intent all the steps data will erased and the intent name will be changed.


### How to add multiple FAQs?


Many time what happens is you want to add multiple FAQs in the bot. While the Yellow Messenger provides a way to do that the easy way too, but repeating the same process for multiple FAQs is a tedious process. (believe us, we've been there!)

Worry not, because we already have a feature specifically for that. Using this feature, you can add multiple FAQs at once through a CSV file.

1. Open the `Studio` and click on `FAQs` button.
2. Here you should see 3 windows: Questions, Question variations and Answers. On the top left bar, click on `Bulk manage` and then `Import`.
3. It will open up a pop-up. We will need a CSV file to upload the FAQs. That CSV file should include "category", "question", "variations", "answer_en" in the column headers. You can also download the format from the link given in the pop-up. Download that file.
4. If you open the downloaded file in Excel or any other spreadsheet editor, it'll look like this.
5. You can also use Google Sheets to edit this file. Now, let's add FAQs.
    - category: Here type in which category you want to add these FAQs. Please make sure that the categories you've entered here exists on the platform.
    - question: What users will ask?
    - variation: Here you can add multiple variations of the question. One thing you need to keep in mind is, first question and variation will remain the same even if you add multiple variations.
    - answer_en: Finally, answer of the respective question. Here 'en' in `answer_en` stands for english. You can add answer in different languages too. For i.e. to add an answer in Hindi you can add column header as `answer_hi`. 
6. Download / save the file as CSV file. Before you upload the file on the platform, we need to ensure if column headers are correct. For that open the CSV file in any text editor like VS Code, Sublime, vim (if you dare) and check if column headers are included in quotes. As you can see in the image below, on line 1 column headers are not wrapped in quotes. 


In that case, you can add quotes manually. Like this in the image given below, checkout line 1. Don't forget to save the changes! üòâ

7. Now let's continue from where we left on step 3. In that pop-up, upload the CSV file. Now click on `Upload` button.

Once the upload it complete, `Done` message will appear. Click on `Return Back`. 

All the FAQs you've added, you can see on the left side. To check if a question has different variations click on any question and you should see multiple question variations (if any) under `Question Variation` tab. Finally on the right most tab, you can see `Answers`. If you want, you add multiple answers also for randomizing.

8. Now you can go back to `Try Your Bot` under `Overview` tab and try one of FAQ you've added eariler. Voila! Congratulations on building your first FAQ bot! üéâ
