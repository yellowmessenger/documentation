## Facebook Lead ads

On Facebook, the brands can roll out forms for generating interest and leads among the Facebook users (or potential customers).

### Pre-filled forms

The major problem with respect to filling forms in general is the poor form completion rate. The users abandon the form perhaps due to more no.of questions.

The FB’s pre-filled forms solve this problem by pre-populating the KYC questions such as name, contact number, email ID. This way the interested usee is expected only to answer the primary requirement they have/the problem they face.

This potentially increases the form completion rate.

## The integration with FB’s lead ads

### The process has two parts

1. Requirements and form creation
2. Lead data storage in the Yellow Messenger’s backend

### Requirements and form creation

1. A valid [business page](https://www.facebook.com/business/products/pages) on Facebook for the brand
2. A link to [privacy policy](https://en-gb.facebook.com/business/help/1247534515288168?id=735435806665862) on what all info you will collect, how do you intend to use the data etc
