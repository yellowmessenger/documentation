There are two parts to an Alexa skill. The first part is the [Voice User Interface (VUI)](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/define-the-interaction-model-in-json-and-text.html). This is where we define how we will handle a user's voice input. The second part is the actual code logic for our skill. Setting up of the VUI will take place completely in the [Amazon Developer Portal](https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.pape.preferred_auth_policies=Singlefactor&clientContext=133-4657237-7550651&openid.pape.max_auth_age=7200000&openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.amazon.com%2Falexa%2Fconsole%2Fask&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=amzn_dante_us&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0&#/skills), while
the actual code logic will be written in the [Platform](https://app.yellowmessenger.com).

11. For the slot values, enter the most likely used utterances for the chatbot. You should enter about 10-15 utterances at least.

12. It’s time to define the intent that sends the text to the backend of the chatbot. Click on ADD+ in “Intents” category.

13. Add an intent called “RawText”.

![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/SHdxO2bu9PaQ1612448232070.png)

14. Now we have to add something called Intent Slots. These intent slots are unique to intents. We have to add an intent slot called “RawTextData” to the intent “RawText”. Click on “RawText” on the left side of the page under the intents header. Then, on the right side of the page, under Intent Slots, type “RawTextData” and click “Add”.

15. You have to set the slot type of the newly created intent slot to “FreeText”

![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/kUF1An0sLMzU1612448320844.png)

16. Now we have to set up the sample utterances for this intent. However, we will only set up one sample utterance, which is going to be the intent slot that we just created. The result of this step will be that whatever is uttered to the Alexa device, will be sent as a raw text to the backend. Type {RawTextData} in the field and press enter.

18. Now that your model has been built, it’s time to configure it with the backend. In the top menu, click “Configuration”.

19. Choose HTTPS as Service Endpoint Type and enter the following URL in Default - https://app.yellowmessenger.com/integrations/alexa/getResponse

21. After configuration, you need to set up the SSL Certificate settings. Choose the second option. Click Next.

(It may look like this - amzn1.ask.skill.111ffc3d-229f-46f7-b537-0c19bf89aca2) Open BotPlatform and navigate to the admin of the desired chatbot that you want to link. In the left menu, click on Channels. Choose Amazon Alexa Skill and paste the Alexa Skill ID that you had copied earlier.
