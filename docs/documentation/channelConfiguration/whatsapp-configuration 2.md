To give an appropriate name, read through the [naming guidelines](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/guides/display-name/).

If the display name you give is different from the legal business name, tick the checkbox as highlighted in the image above.

10. Stay with me. We are progressing. Select the industry that you are functioning. You can also give a description about your business. We recommend you fill this.

Example description: _"XYZ is an organic food brand that offers fresh and exotic farm-grown fruits._
