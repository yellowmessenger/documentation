## Introduction

Slack is a workplace communication tool, “a single place for messaging, tools and files.” This means Slack is an instant messaging system with lots of add-ins for other workplace tools. Slack has an intuitive UI with both group and person-to-person messaging. These are more than 1500 apps and allows users to create their own app which has evolved Slack to become a one-stop-shop for a lot of users.

### Slack context management using YM

Slack provides threaded messaging so It is important to understand how yellow messenger platform handles the context in channel, threads and in DM.

**Channel:**

1. Bot will always reply in respective thread
2. Each thread conserve independent context, if multiple threads are activated by same/different person → bot will maintain individual context/journey for each thread. Parallelly same journey can be run in different threads.
3. Each thread has its own local memory (app.memory), So local memory cannot be accessible cross threads, cross channels, groups. Use global memory for cross memory requirements.
4. User profile is preserved cross channels/threads/DMs therefore oauth/integrations/tokens is accessible for user irrespective of channels.

**DM:**

1. Bot will always reply in 1-1 conversation (no threads formation)
2. Bot ignore thread formation for better conversational experience
3. Local memory is accessible within DM irrespective of threads.

## Configuration of single / multi-workspace

Slack App can be built for both single workspace use cases like building for a particular organisation or can be built for multi-tenant workspaces like building apps for marketplace.

### Single Workspace:

Slack app uses bot access token (xoxb) to communicate with workspace users, **Bot access token** is obtained when the slack workspace admin add the app to their workspace.

**Steps to configure single workspace:**
**Step 1:** Goto OAuth & Permissions, Click on the Install App to Workspace

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/S5shb-6GRvLCvG3opxTTG63ACIz376s-ZpqJEX9-wzkjlrs0uD7T1_O8nplucvCLCZIwYEG0tw_7PdMF6gWLfBm5FN_zY6SAT4JdnOV9cAYdBPiHzPxHPY-wE92ssXII493mh2h7)


**Step 2:** Select a channel, incase you have enabled external incoming webhooks (https://api.slack.com/apps/[APPID]/incoming-webhooks)

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KUbz_iS-iAoOOhmVcPAc-eO0JSJIIiyMp6NCh9ez5BLkWCtW2Z-tlwGCCvs1TO_QoGtW59lJSb9OOkYsoe5toOiF5u49h1gPCEfFaTZ6BaXQxDPSApUpxof5eXq2gMH4VUJkMFgQ)


**Step 3:** After installing the app to workspace, go back to the **OAuth & Permission** copy the Bot Access token (xoxb- ) and paste at the Yellow messenger > Channels > Slack > Add the Slack access token > Save.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ibx2cKKWZaAxk-HMR3ZUsL2fNUhwmqeXlm32m1MrHPbWkqFuPq8MU4GH1AE_Rspw3XxzlQ1W4i9ZsmHUXpN6JX1EWTSFpbnmn9v8dwUqBv_3pKVMDDOgZbJM5iKcTyF9TMhorXI4)



### Multiple Workspace:

Slack multi-workspace can be handled using the OAuth token, YM bot will map the bot access token according to the requesting user workspace

**Steps to configure multi workspace**
**Step 1:** Goto [https://api.slack.com/apps/](https://api.slack.com/apps/) > Basic Information on the left panel and copy the Client ID & Client Secret.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mUMeIHSjnvZG45kYDtSs6I-eFySQnKmsaljmKAJTGiO3nJ_OR88cHHATazCGg11q2ZKaneGkNW-gFmxPvsidPQj_eYvMB7368Jxq8JZ5c7h149-f3Aam1hA0EafAOg8kzLZupEwy)


**Step 2:** Paste the client ID, Client Secret and scopes (comma separated) in the yellow messenger Slack channel OAuth Tokens

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UAsBEeONP3wbUE224ruAto5mYvq13bgc0KJmsCNjJY3-SqmozPvoeD1BeKt-l-8bklw42L4bg0GJUl8l3AeXS-9DtJK9Y5e9vFeY_QEkpxDT1FNVnr7oCx8EmWxZ6FnK2v-ncQCy)



**Step 3:** For manual / development purposes you can use the **Connect** button to connect the slack app to the workspace. For marketplace share following install url to connect the app to their workspaces with YM platform. [https://app.yellowmessenger.com/integrations/slack/install/](https://app.yellowmessenger.com/integrations/slack/install/)*botId*

![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/RzDD6tuFd2n91612443533385.png)


In case of multi workspace bot access token can be obtained using:
```js
    app.getAccessToken().then(slackTAuth => { app.log(slackTAuth) })
```
## Adding Slack app to Direct message / Channel

After adding the Slack app to the workspace, you are required to add the app to a group or DM for testing or interacting with the bot.

**Adding slack app to DM:**
Use the **+** button near **Apps** and **Select the app** > Add > **Messages**
, or search the App using the top workspace search.

**Adding slack app to Group / Channel:**
Goto Channel details > More > View App in channels
Now you can add / remove the app to the channel.

**Message event format at YM**
Test your bot using **app.sendTextMessage("Hi")**

    app.log(app.data)

**DM:** Bot will reply in 1-1 conversation fashion (no threads will be formed)
```js
    {
            "message": "Hi",
            "slackChannel": "D01BXXXV4TD",   //D stand for DM channel
            "userId": "U01B4XXX9A7",         // slack userID of sender
            "threadTs": "",                  // threadID (not present in DM)
            "channelType": "im",             //im => DM
            "eventType": "message"        //event can be from message/button/slash etc
    }
```

**Group / Channel :** Bot will reply in the threads and context will be mentioned within the respective threads only, app.memory will be accessible within the particular thread only.
Group : private,
Channel: public.
```js
    {
            "message": "Hi",
            "slackChannel": "G01CNXXXP7S",   //G stand for group / C stand for channel
            "userId": "U01B4XXX9A7",           // slack userID of sender
            "threadTs": "1605XXX466.000200",   // threadID
            "channelType": "group",            //from group / from channel
            "eventType": "message"        //event can be from message/button/slash etc
    }
```

## Slack APIs integration

The Slack Web API is an interface for querying information from and enacting change in a Slack workspace.
Reference: [https://api.slack.com/methods](https://api.slack.com/methods)

**Api to fetch user info in a workspace.**
```js
    {
            name: "user_info",
            type: "GET",
            encoding: "utf8",
            url: "https://slack.com/api/users.info",
            headers: [],
            params: [{
                            key: "user",
                            value: "{{userID}}"
                    },
                    {
                            key: "token",
                            value: "{{{slacktoken}}}"
                    }
            ]
    }
```
**Bot accessToken**:

1. For single workspace configuration:
   > let slackTAuth = app.oauth.mapping.slackAuthToken
2. For multi-workspace configuration:
   > app.getAccessToken().then(slackTAuth => { app.log(slackTAuth) })

## Slack Interactive Features
### Block Kit:

Slack has its own way to present messages in interactive fashion using message blocks, **app.sendTextMessage()** and **Quick Replies** will work on Slack but **app.sendCards()** will not work.

Slack Block Kit gives you a way to create rich, interactive UI for your app. Each block displays or handles information in a different way, and multiple blocks can stack to form:

1. Message block: *Rich message (styled text, action buttons, drop-downs etc)*
![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FXfkmRGsdu6YrEMbLnqzG2Fwt8l_XW5Orl7T9Q4LN2CSfnfJusfml9j-hpJ5T1Q8z_z2sNfOK5pP6bQZ0vHjlV2OkjdHCXoJQfDJMSFfJ549Uu9DTmnC7U_KmWy5J-PN0BlYmo6I)

2. Attachments: *Similar to Message block, automatic collapse lengthy message with expand button.*
3. Modals: *Pop-up to allow users to fill a form.*
4. App Home: *Layout of home tab of app.*

Slack has its own designer to design blocks.
[https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder/](https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder/)

**Sending message block using YM:**
Message block allows you to send message as section and actions type
```js
    app.sendActions({
        "blocks": [
            {
                "type": "section",
                "text": {
                    "type": "plain_text",
                    "text": "Click below to continue",
                    "emoji": true
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "actions",
                "elements": [
                    {
                          "type": "button",
                          "text": {
                                "type": "plain_text",
                                "text": "Continue",
                                "emoji": true
                          },
                          "value": "value123",
                          "action_id": "action123"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    })
```
**Event receive on button click**
```js
    app.log(app.data)
    {
            "action_id": "action123",
            "text": {
                    "type": "plain_text",
                    "text": "Continue"
            },
            "value": "value123",
            "type": "button",
            "channelName": "directmessage",
            "userId": "U01BXXXX9A7",
    }
```
**Sending message attachments using YM:**
```js
    app.sendActions({"attachments": [{"blocks": [ … ]}]})
```
Button click event will be the same as the message block case.

### Modals:

Modals provide focused spaces ideal for requesting and collecting data from users, or temporarily displaying dynamic and interactive information.

![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/X5rzc67VwGFE1612443582779.png)


Each modal consists of some standardized UI elements — a title, an *x* button to dismiss the modal, a *cancel* button — that wrap around a fully-customizable space — the modal's **view**.
Reference: [https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using)

This interaction happened **only using button** which is capable of creating trigger_id, trigger_id is handled automatically in backend of YM, the app is sent a payload containing a special trigger_id.
Modals can be designed using [block-kit-builder](https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder/).

**Sending modals using YM**
```js
    //After receiving event of button click action
    app.sendModal({
            "type": "modal",
            "submit": {...},
            "private_metadata": JSON.stringify(metadata), //sending private data / IDs .
            "close": {..},
            "title": {...},
            "blocks": [
                  {
                        "type": "input",
                                    "block_id": "block123",
                        "label": {
                                "type": "plain_text",
                                "text": "Anything else you want to tell us?",
                        },
                        "element": {
                                "type": "plain_text_input",
                                "multiline": true
                        },
                        "action_id": "action123",
                        "optional": true
                  },
                  {
                        "type": "divider"
                  }
          ]
    })
```

**Event receive at YM after submission**
```js
    app.log(app.data)
    {
      "userId": "U01B4XXX9A7",
        "event": {

                                            }
                                    }
                                }
                          }
                    }
          }
    }}
```
