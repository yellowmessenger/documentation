## Design your conversations

There can be multiple use cases for which you started building a bot - in most cases to automate some service/business function, with a conversational layer on top of it.

> To take an example, suppose you wish to build a travel assistant bot, and these are the things you wish to handle-

- Flight tickets booking
- Hotel bookings
- Flight status
- Flight cancellation/rescheduling
- Hotel stay cancellation/rescheduling
- Answering customer FAQs
- Customer support

Above points describe the scope of your bot, ie, what can your bot help your customers with. Once you're clear with what you want to do, first thing you will start with is designing the flow of conversation, right from where the conversation starts.
