## Step 1: Start conversing

Now that you have given an identity for your bot, you can start teaching it how to talk to people. Configure the 'Welcome Prompt' node to decide how your bot should start a conversation.

## Step 2: A conversation can go 2 ways

Either your bot understands what the user is saying or it does not. We have preconfigured the 2-way flow for you

## Step 3: Create Journeys and add nodes

Now you can create journeys to trigger the most appropriate conversation based on what the user says. In the journeys, you can tell your bot what to do at every node.

## Step 4: Train your bot to understand conversations

How can your bot understand what the user says? This can be achieved by training your bot with Imtents and Entities

## Step 5: It is okay for your bot to not understand everything

None of us like a non responsive bot if it does not understand what we say. Add fallback options, suggestions and even document searching capabilities to your bot to give a response at all times.
