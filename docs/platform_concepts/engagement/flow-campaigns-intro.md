Yellow.ai's Flow Campaign is a  conversational marketing tool  with an advanced campaign builder. It helps marketers deliver a comprehensive customer experience across channels and engage customers at every stage of their journey.

A Flow Campaign consists of  user journeys  which you can use to strategically target customers across channels. You can quickly develop flows using the no-code builder according to your business needs. This also allows you to track  customer activities  across platforms and analyze the data to make decisions.

You have two options to create Flow campaigns:

1. [Build campaigns manually from scratch](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/flows_campaign)
2. [Generate Flow campaign using AI](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/flow-ai)
  
### Flow campaigns use cases

This sample use case shows how to effectively engage users by nudging them at different stages in a flow using the Flow campaign.

Consider a cart abandonment example in an e-commerce store.

1. Send a reminder message through a Push notification to proceed with the purchase after one day.
2. For users who have read the push notification, send an exclusive 10% off coupon on WhatsApp.
3. If the user has not responded to the message, resend the coupon over WhatsApp after 48 hours.
4. Wait a couple more days and end the flow.
 


## Brand settings for Flow campaigns

* **Describe about brand**: Enter essential details about your brand within a limit of 1,000 characters.
