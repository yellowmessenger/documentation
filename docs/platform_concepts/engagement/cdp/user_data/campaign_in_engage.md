title: Creating Hyper-personalised Campaigns in Engage
---

If you’ve built a campaigns on yellow.ai, you can use the [Outbound campaign](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/outbound-campaigns/run-campaign) to create hyper-personalised engagements based on user data.

To improve engagement rates of your campaigns, it’s extremely important to target the right set of users, with the right content.

### Creating the right content
You can use the [template manager](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/templates/overview) to create the content you want to target your users with. It is possible to add variables in a template by using **{{variableName}}**

During your [outbound campaign](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/outbound-campaigns/run-campaign) creation, the above variables can be mapped to user properties while selecting the message template

### Targeting the right set of users
In the target audience step, you can choose the [segment](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data_segments/creating_managing_user_segment) you want to target with the above content. You can also create a new segment by clicking on **+ New segment**, which will allow you to create highly targeted [segments with And/Or conditions](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data/targeted_segments).
