# Knowledge base overview

The Knowledge Base is a centralized source of truth that helps your AI agent deliver accurate, consistent, and context-aware responses. It allows you to import, organize, and manage content from various sources such as documents, websites, articles, and third-party systems.

Use the Knowledge Base to ensure your AI agent has access to the latest and most relevant information, reducing manual effort and improving response quality across support, service, and informational use cases.


## What you can do

* Import content from multiple sources, including file uploads, URLs, articles, and third-party platforms like ServiceNow.
* Schedule automatic syncs to keep your content up to date.
* Tag content with metadata to improve search relevance.
* Organize documents using folders and subfolders by team, topic, or category.
* Monitor content status and sync activity in real time.


### Supported content sources

You can add content from:

* **Files**: Upload PDFs, Word documents, Excel sheets, and more.
* **Web sources**: Use URLs or sitemaps to pull content from your website.
* **Articles**: Create and manage articles directly within the platform to provide structured and editable information to your AI Agent.
* **Third-party systems**: Connect to external platforms like ServiceNow.

Each source is automatically processed and made searchable by the AI agent. You can view the sync status of each document in the dashboard.

Inputting a website URL into the Knowledge base triggers the creation of a customized AI-agent. This AI-agent is designed to extract and leverage pertinent information from the provided URL, facilitating automated responses and enhancing user engagement.

With Knowledge base, you can achieve: 
- **Efficiency**: Automation reduces manual AI-agent creation efforts and ensures real-time adaptation to website changes.
- **Customization**: AI-agents are tailored to the unique structure and content of each website, optimizing user engagement.
- **Scalability**: Easily scalable for applications ranging from small business websites to large-scale e-commerce platforms.

This feature, driven by Yellow.ai's exclusive **Automation** module (not GPT), uses a functionality similar to **Document Cognition (Doc Cog)** to support knowledge base responses.

#### KnowledgeBase vs. Doc Cog

The distinction between Doc Cog and the Zero Setup Knowledgebase lies in their response to user queries. While v1.Doc Cog retrieves precise information from its source when a user requests it, the Zero Setup Knowledgebase not only provides the answer to the query but also presents a condensed summary of the information, enhancing the user experience with additional context.



### Use cases

- **Automated website FAQs**:
The Knowledgebase can be utilized to create a AI-agent that automatically responds to FAQs by extracting information directly from the website. This reduces the burden on customer support teams and ensures quick and accurate responses.


- **Product information retrieval**:
Knowledgebase allows the automated AI-agent to retrieve the latest product details, availability, and pricing information directly from the website. This ensures that customers receive accurate and real-time information about the products they are interested in.

- **Dynamic content updates**:
By integrating Knowledgebase, the AI-agent can be configured to pull the most recent content updates from the website. This ensures that users interacting with the AI-agent receive the latest information without manual content management.

- **Interactive learning platforms**:
Knowledgebase can be employed to create a AI-agent that guides learners through specific topics based on the content available on the website. The AI-agent serves as an interactive learning assistant, responding to queries and providing information within the scope of the website's content.
