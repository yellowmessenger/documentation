2. Enter an API name. API names are alpha-numeric names in Camel Case and we can not have multiple APIs with the same name. The [joke API](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke) used below returns a joke with a punchline in the GET request.

3. Once added, you can test the API by hitting `Send` button. If the API is correctly added and the endpoint works, you should be able to see a sample response as below.
