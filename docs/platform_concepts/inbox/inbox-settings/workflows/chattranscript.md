As a common practice in the support industry, the conversation between the live agent and the customer is sent to the customer (after the conversation ends) as a **chat transcript** that can be used as a reference for the customer. 

Yellow.ai's Inbox provides an option to send the chat transcripts.  Follow the steps below to enable chat transcript functionality: 

1. Open **Inbox** > **Settings**. 
2. Search and select **Chat transcript**.

    - All the [configured email IDs](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/tickets/setupandconfig) are available on the dropdown menu, depending on the preference of the business an email ID can be selected.

6. To send the chat transcript to the customers, the customer email ID must be present on the platform. This can be fetched from the bot flows or the live agent can ask the customer for their email ID and add it in the [chat details](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/chats/chatscreen#2-user-details). After the chat is resolved, the transcript will automatically be sent to the customer.
