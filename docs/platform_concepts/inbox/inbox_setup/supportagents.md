In this article, you will learn how to accept/add inbox roles. 


:::note
- **Admin** (of the bot) can give access to **Inbox Admin/Agent** to any user (or themselves).     
- Users with **Inbox Admin** access can add **Inbox Agents** (these agents can become **Suprevisors** of a particular group).
- Any user provided with **Inbox Agents** invite can join as a inbox agent. 
- Users with only **Inbox Admin/Agent** roles can access only **Inbox module** on the yellow.ai platform.
:::



-----


- There are two major roles to access the inbox module, **Inbox Admin** and **Inbox Agent**. **Inbox Supervisor** role can be provided to an inbox agent based on the industry requirement. 
- Incoming live chats and email tickets (from the customers) are assigned only to the **Inbox agents** (support agents).
- **Inbox agents** will have access to the **chats/tickets/analytics/performance** to help understand and resolve queries in Inbox.
- Other modules in the yellow.ai platform such as **Studio**, **Channels**, etc. will not be visible to the **Inbox Admin/Agent**.
- If you have **Admin** access(to the bot), you can give yourself the **Inbox Agent/Inbox Admin** access to explore the Inbox functionalities. In the **Users** tab, **Edit** your row to add **Inbox agent** access along with **Inbox admin** access.
