## <a name="i5"></a> Orchestrator bot feature in Inbox

Use the [Orchestrator](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/create_chatbot#create-orchestrator-bot) feature to unify multiple AI agents under one Inbox:

- Create a **parent AI agents** and connect **child AI agents** from the same subscription.  
- Enable **"Unify inbox to all child bots"** to centralize all support tickets into the parent AI agent's Inbox.  
- Simplifies operations for agents managing multiple AI agents.
