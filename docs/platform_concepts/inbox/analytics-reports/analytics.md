:::note
Chat analytics metrics are shown according to the time when the chats were active. For instance, if two chats, one initiated on February 1st and another resolved on February 2nd,  resolved chats metric will include both the chats. The metrics consider the entire duration when the chats were active, not just the resolution date.

In Inbox, analytics can be viewed and exported (as CSV files) for the following:

1. **Chats analytics**: View analytics for all the [types of chats](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/chats/getstartedwithlivechat). Monitor chat support performance and metrics.

4. For each selected date range, the system calculates the average data and presents the percentage increase or decrease relative to the previous date range. For instance, if the user selects **Last 90 days** as the range, the average **First response time** is displayed as 20 hours and 52 minutes. The percentage difference between the **First response time** in the last 90 days and the preceding 90 days is presented as the delta value.
