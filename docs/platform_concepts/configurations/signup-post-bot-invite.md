### Managing Subscription:

Each user who signs up on cloud.yellow.ai has their own subscription provided to them.
So the bot that they build, falls under the default subscription provided to them.
Whenever another platform user shares bot access with you to collaborate,  you have to first accept the invite and then switch to their subscription to access their bot.
1. To switch your subscription, Go to your profile and click on Billing.
