We have made your life easy by creating bots. There are readily available templates in our **Marketplace** that have a lot of flows based on real-time use cases. You will also see recommendations specific to your industry that you can just plug-and-play and start running your bot.

However, there could be some use cases that are not available in our Marketplace. You can use [Studio](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/overview) to completely build your bot from scratch.
