# Migration Guide

Version 1.x had an issue where a corrupted ymAuthentication token was passed in some cases from SDK to the server. The conversation history was thus mapped to the corrupted ymAuthenticationToken

Version 2.x has fix for this issue and thus a correct ymAuthenticationToken is always passed.
However, as the correct ymAuthentication is different from the corrupted token, our server treats this user as a new user which leads to a complete loss of history of user conversations.
The user will have a fresh start after updating the app.

Note:

1. ymAuthentication was corrupted only when it contained `=` character in 1.x versions
2. This issue was happening only on Android platform.

For more info feel free to email us at mobile@yellow.ai

## Installation

### Gradle

To integrate YMChat into your Android project using gradle, specify the following configurations in App level `build.gradle` file

```gradle
repositories {
    jcenter()
    // Add these two lines
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/" }
}

...
...
...

dependencies {
    ...
    ...
	   implementation 'com.github.yellowmessenger:YMChatbot-Android:2.2.+
}
```

Note: By puting + at the end, you need not to worry about updating and releaseing your app for every patch we are making in SDK.
Still, if you want to use exact and latest version please visit the github repository mentioned
[https://github.com/yellowmessenger/YMChatbot-Android/releases](https://github.com/yellowmessenger/YMChatbot-Android/releases)

### File provider

:::note
Note: Only for version v1.4.0 to v.2.5.0. Post v.2.5.0 it is not required to add following key in your strings.xml
:::

Add following key in your `strings.xml` file, this will override default file provider used by SDK.

Overriding the file provider path will avoid conflict with other app using YM CHATBOT SDK. You can use your application id and suffix it with ".fileprovider"
Example - applicationId : "com.abc.xyz" then application_id_for_provider = com.abc.xyz.fileprovider

```xml
<string name="application_id_for_provider">your.application.id.fileprovider</string>
```

## Basic Usage

Import the YMChat library in your Activity.

```java
import com.yellowmessenger.ymchat.YMChat;
import com.yellowmessenger.ymchat.YMConfig;
```

After the library is imported the basic bot can be presented with few lines as below

Example `onCreate` method of the Activity:

```java

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
	super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    // Dummy bot id. (Purrs a lot)
    String botID = "x1587041004122";

    //Get YMChat instance
	YMChat ymChat = YMChat.getInstance();
	ymChat.config = new YMConfig(botId);
	setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
	FloatingActionButton fab = findViewById(R.id.fab);
	fab.setOnClickListener(view -> {
		//Starting the bot activity
		try {
            ymChat.startChatbot(this);
          } catch (Exception e) {
           //Catch and handle the exception
            e.printStackTrace();
          }
	});
}
```

## YMConfig

YMConfig can be used to set the bot id and other bot related settings. It is recommended to set all appropriate config **before** starting the bot

### Initialize YMConfig

YMConfig requires `botID` to initialize. All other settings are optional.

```java
ymChat.config = new YMConfig("<BOT-ID>");
```

### YM AuthenticationToken

ymAuthenticationToken is used to associate an identity of the user with the chat bot.

Whenever chatbot is launched with ymAuthenticationToken it will load the previous chats associated with this user since **inception**.

```java
ymChat.config.ymAuthenticationToken = "your-token"
```

:::note
History will load only when `Show history` flag is enabled in the channel settings.

## Code snippets for Android Push notifications

Notifications are sent to Firebase which then pushes them to the app using the user's device token. This section provides payloads that are sent to Firebase for different on-tap actions (action performed when the user taps on the push notification).

The following table provides descriptions of different parameters:

Parameter | Datatype | Description
--------- | -------- | ---------
notification | Object | Details of the notification
title | String | Title of the notification.
body | String | Content of the notification.
payload | String | Contains additional parameters such as image, botId, deeplink and journeySlug.
botId | String | The bot ID for which the notification has been triggered.
image | String | Path of the image file or URL of the image.
deeplink | String | URL which redirects the user to a particular page of the application.
journeySlug | String | The name of the journey which has to be triggered in the bot, when the user taps on the notification
token* | String | A unique identifier or device ID generated for the operating system and specific device. Notifications are sent to the user's device ID.

:::note
* Parameters with * are mandatory.
* Either `deviceToken` or `ymAuthToken` is needed. For campaigns, `deviceToken` is mandatory and `ymAuthToken` is optional. <br/>However, to push notifications from from your app to User 360, only `ymAuthToken` is required.
* Ensure you create users along with their device and ym authentication tokens.
* When sending out notifications, the yellow.ai consumes these details automatically, decides the platform, and sends out notifications accordingly.
:::

### Notification without custom action
  
This is used to redirect to the main activity of the app when a user clicks on the notification - On tap action, open the app (your app). See Step 7 of [Push notification template](/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/templates/mobilepush).

We do not send any payload, instead, we just trigger the notification containing the title and body along with the image (if included). There is no action included in the payload.

```js
{
    "notification": {
        "title": "Hey there",
        "body": "Body",
        "image": "{ImageUrl}"
    },
    "token": "{deviceToken}"
}
```

### Notification with deep link

This is used for the On tap action to open a deep link to the app - when a user clicks on the notification, it redirects to a specific screen of the app where the deeplink is pointing to.

The payload consists of the standard notification details (title, body, and image) along with the `botId` and `deeplink` URI.

```js
{
    "notification": {
        "title": "Hey there",
        "body": "Body",
        "image": "{imageUrl}"
    },
    "data": {
        "botId": {botId},
        "deeplink": "{uri}"
    },
    "token": "{deviceToken}"
}
```

### Notification with bot response

This is used for the On tap action to open a specific bot flow - when a user clicks on the notification, it opens the bot that can [trigger a specific bot flow](#payload-to-trigger-bot-flow) or [shows a predefined response](#payload-to-open-the-bot-with-a-predefined-response).

#### Payload to trigger bot flow

Here is the payload to trigger a specific bot flow when the user clicks on the notification.

```js
{
    "notification": {
        "title": "Hey there",
        "body": "Body",
        "image": "{imageUrl}"
    },
    "data": {
        "botId": "{botId}",
        "journeySlug": "{slug}"
    },
    "token": "{deviceToken}"
}
```


#### Payload to open the bot with a predefined response

Here is the payload to show a specific bot response (text message) when the user clicks on the notification.

It just contains `botId` in the response under the `data` parameter. 

```js
{
    "notification": {
        "title": "Hey there",
        "body": "Body",
        "image": "{imageUrl}"
    },
    "data": {
        "botId": "{botId}",
    },
    "token": "{deviceToken}"
}
```


## Implementation codes for Android push notifications 

The following are the code snippets for the Android app developer to get the notifications and handle different scenarios.


### Fetch additional data from notifications when clicked

Use the following code snippet fetch additional information from the user when the user clicks on the notification.

```js
HashMap < String, Object > payloadData = new HashMap < > ();
HashMap < String, Object > botPayloadData = new HashMap < > ();

Bundle bundle = getIntent().getExtras();
if (bundle != null) {
    String tmp = "";
    for (String key: bundle.keySet()) {
        Object value = bundle.get(key);
        payloadData.put(key, value);
        tmp += key + ": " + value + "\n\n";
    }
    mTextView.setText(tmp);
}
```

### Start chatbot with bot details and additional data

Use the following code snippet to open the bot and trigger a specific bot flow when the user clicks on the notification. 

```js
if (payloadData.get("botId") != null) {
    String botId = (String) payloadData.get("botId");
    YMChat ymChat = YMChat.getInstance();

    ymChat.config = new YMConfig(botId);
    ymChat.config.version = 2;
    ymChat.config.ymAuthenticationToken = "2gs20emoof1666164936076";

    if (payloadData.get("journeySlug") != null) {
        String journeySlug = (String) payloadData.get("journeySlug");
        botPayloadData.put("JourneySlug", journeySlug);
        ymChat.config.payload = botPayloadData;
    }

    try {
        ymChat.startChatbot(this);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

### Handle notifications in the foreground when the bot is closed

Use the following code snippet to handle the notifications you receive when the app is open in the foreground.

```js
import android.util.Log
import com.google.firebase.messaging.FirebaseMessagingService
import com.google.firebase.messaging.RemoteMessage

class MyFirebaseMessagingService: FirebaseMessagingService() {
    final
    var TAG: String = "YMLog"
    override fun onMessageReceived(remoteMessage: RemoteMessage) {
        Log.i(TAG + " Remote message", remoteMessage.toString())
        Log.i(TAG + " Remote message", remoteMessage.data.toString())
        super.onMessageReceived(remoteMessage)
    }
}
```

* [Test app with Android SDK and Firebase integration](https://github.com/yellowmessenger/YmChatBot-Android-DemoApp)
:::


### Push Notifications

YMChat supports firebase notifications. Assign your `FCM token` to deviceToken

```java
ymChat.config.deviceToken = "your-firebase-device-token"
```
:::note Mapping Firebase service key against Bot Id
Firebase service account Json file is required to send notifications. You need to map service account json file against your bot ID. Request your contact person from `yellow.ai` to share api for same. For more information about Firebase service account json file and how to get it check link [here](https://developers.google.com/assistant/engagement/notifications#get_a_service_account_key)
:::

### Payload

Additional information can be passed in the form of key value pair from app to bot using payload.

```java
HashMap<String, Object> payloadData = new HashMap<>();
//Setting Payload Data
payloadData.put("some-key", "some-value");
ymChat.config.payload = payloadData;
```

Payload can be used to pass information from host app to bot. The payload dictionary should be JSON compatible else an error will be thrown

For passing data from bot to app refer bot [Bot Events](#bot-events)

:::note payload security
Payload is securely passed in HTTPS post request to protect the information passed in it
:::

#### Trigger journey

A specific journey can be triggered on launch, by passing the slug in the payload.

```java
HashMap<String, Object> payloadData = new HashMap<>();
//Setting Payload Data
payloadData.put("JourneySlug", "checkout-cart");
ymChat.config.payload = payloadData;
```

### On Premise / Region Specific deployments

Your on-prem deployment URL can be set to `customBaseUrl`

```java
ymChat.config.customBaseUrl = "https://yourcustomurl.com";
```

If the bot is deployed in a specific region (Example: r1,r2,r3..rn) on yellow.ai cloud, set the `customBaseUrl` as follows

```java
ymChat.config.customBaseUrl = "https://rx.cloud.yellow.ai";
```
Here rx = r1,r2,r3,r4,r5 etc.

### Custom loader

You can customize the loading image while bot loads. Just pass the URL in the following way. It is recommended to use jpg, png, svg or gif

```java
ymChat.config.customLoaderUrl = "https://example.com/your/custom/image.gif"
```

### V2 bot

You can enable V2 bot by setting the version in config. Default value is 1

```java
ymChat.config.version = 2;
```

### Speech to Text

Speech to text can be enabled by setting the enableSpeech flag present in config. Default value is `false`

```java
ymChat.config.enableSpeech = true
```

:::note Imporant
To enable Speech to text Please add record audio permission  (`<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />`) in manifest file.
:::

### Hide Input Bar

You can hide the input bar while bot is loading by setting the disableActionsOnLoad flag present in config. Default value is `false`

```java
ymChat.config.disableActionsOnLoad = true
```
### Use Lite version 

You can use lite version of the bot by setting the useLiteVersion flag present in config. Default value is `false`

```java
ymChat.config.useLiteVersion = true
```

### Colors

#### Status bar

Status bar color can be set on `statusBarColor` color variable

```java
ymChat.config.statusBarColor = R.color.red
```

or

```java
ymChat.config.statusBarColorFromHex = "#FF0000"
```

Note: if both `statusBarColor` and `statusBarColorFromHex` is used then `statusBarColorFromHex` will take priority

#### Close button

Close button color can be set on `closeButtonColor`

```java
ymChat.config.closeButtonColor = R.color.white
```

or

```java
ymChat.config.closeButtonColorHex = "#FFFFFF"
```

Note: if both `closeButtonColor` and `closeButtonColorFromHex` is used then `closeButtonColorFromHex` will take priority

## Starting the bot

Once the config is set, chat bot can be presented by calling `startChatbot()` and passing your Activity context as an argument

```java
ymChat.startChatbot(this);
```

## Get Chatbot Fragment

If clients want to use Chatbot Fragment in thier application, they can call the following method to get the fragment

```java
Fragment chatbotView = ymChat.getChatBotView(this);
```

Clients can embed this fragment in their activity and begin the transaction as they do for any other fragment.

## Bot Events

Bot events are used to pass information from bot to app. Events from bot can be handled using event Listeners. Simply define the `onSuccess` method of `onEventFromBot` listener.

```java
ymChat.onEventFromBot(botEvent -> {
	switch (botEvent.getCode()) {
	case "event-name": break;
	}
});
```

#### Bot close event

Bot close event is separately sent and it can be handled by listening to onBotClose event as mentioned below. To programatically close bot use `ymChat.closeBot()` method

```java
ymChat.onBotClose(() -> {
  Log.d("Example App", "Bot Was closed");
 });
```

## Close bot

Bot can be programatically closed using `closeBot()` function

```java
ymChat.closeBot();
```

## Reload bot

To reload the bot with the same configuration, use the `reloadBot()` function. This will reload the bot without closing and reopening it.

```java
ymChat.reloadBot();
```

## Register Device

If you want to receiving push notifications without or before launching the bot, you can register your device.
To use this api `apiKey`, `botId`, `deviceToken` and `ymAuthenticationToken` are mandatory parameters.

```java
    try {
            YMChat ymChat = YMChat.getInstance();
            //Mandatory config  `botId`, `deviceToken` and `ymAuthenticationToken`
            YMConfig ymConfig = new YMConfig("your bot id");
            ymConfig.deviceToken = "your FCM Token";
            ymConfig.ymAuthenticationToken = "your ymAuthentiction token";
            // Set custom base url in case your bot does not belong to india region and yellow cloud
            // Example- If your bot is in `r5` region custom base url would be `https://r5.cloud.yellow.ai
            // ymConfig.customBaseUrl = "https://r5.cloud.yellow.ai";
            ymChat.registerDevice(apiKey, ymConfig, new YellowCallback() {
                @Override
                public void success() {
                    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Device Registered", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                }

                @Override
                public void failure(String message) {
                    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                }
            });
        } catch (Exception e) {
            //Catch and handle the exception
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
```

## Unlink Device Token

If you want to stop receiving push notifications you can unlink the device.
To use this api `apiKey`, `botId` and `deviceToken` are mandatory parameters.
Device token typically is unlinked when the user logs out of the app.

```java
    try {
            YMChat ymChat = YMChat.getInstance();
            YMConfig ymConfig = new YMConfig("your bot id");
            // Set the FCM token as device token, this is required so that it can be removed and customer stop receiving the notification
            ymConfig.deviceToken = "your FCM Token";
            // Set custom base url in case your bot does not belong to india region and yellow cloud
            // Example- If your bot is in `r5` or EURO region custom base url would be `https://r5.cloud.yellow.ai
            // ymConfig.customBaseUrl = "https://r5.cloud.yellow.ai";
            ymChat.unlinkDeviceToken(apiKey, ymConfig, new YellowCallback() {
                @Override
                public void success() {
                    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Token unlinked", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                }

                @Override
                public void failure(String message) {
                    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                }
            });
        } catch (Exception e) {
            //Catch and handle the exception
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
```

:::note API Key
API key can be generated/found by visiting `https://cloud.yellow.ai` -> Overview -> Configure -> API Key section

Existing client can upgrade their dependency to `v2.1.+` and replace exisitng key with new API Key.
Client using SDK version below `v2.1.0` will have no impact.
:::

## Unread Message Count

If you want to show an indicator in your app if there is any unread messages, you can achieve that by calling the given api when bot is in closed state.
Pre condition to use this api is that customer must have opened the bot at least once with `ymAuthenticationToken` otherwise you will receive an error message.
To use this api `botId` and `ymAuthenticationToken` are mandatory parameters.

```java
        try {
            YMChat ymChat = YMChat.getInstance();
            YMConfig ymConfig = new YMConfig("your bot id");
            // `ymAuthenticationToken` is required to identify the right
            ymConfig.ymAuthenticationToken = "your ymAuthentiction token";
            // Set custom base url in case your bot does not belong to india region and yellow cloud
            // Example- If your bot is in `r5` region custom base url would be `https://r5.cloud.yellow.ai
            // ymConfig.customBaseUrl = "https://r5.cloud.yellow.ai";
            ymChat.getUnreadMessagesCount(ymConfig, new YellowDataCallback() {
                @Override
                public <T> void success(T data) {
                    YellowUnreadMessageResponse response = (YellowUnreadMessageResponse) data;
                    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Unread messages - " + response.getUnreadCount(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                }

                @Override
                public void failure(String message) {
                    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                }
            });
        } catch (Exception e) {
            //Catch and handle the exception
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
```
