]
```

### Add Package directly to your Swift Project

![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/3NnDTb2GSSDG1644486017511.png)

:::info Supported iOS versions:
iOS 12 and above
:::

## Basic Usage

Import the `YMChat` framework in the Swift file

```swift
import YMChat
```

After the framework is imported the bot can be presented with few lines as below

```swift
do {
    let config = YMConfig(botId: "x1234567890")
    YMChat.shared.config = config
    try YMChat.shared.startChatbot(on: self)
} catch {
    print("Error occured while loading chatbot \(error)")
}
```

## YMConfig

YMConfig can be used to set the bot id and other bot related settings. It is recommended to set all appropriate config **before** starting the bot

### Initialize YMConfig

YMConfig requires `botID` to initialize. All other settings are optional.

```swift
let config = YMConfig(botId: "<bot-id>")
```

### YM AuthenticationToken

ymAuthenticationToken is used to associate an identity of the user with the chat bot.

Whenever chatbot is launched with ymAuthenticationToken it will load the previous chats associated with this user since **inception**.

```swift
config.ymAuthenticationToken = "your-token"
```

Note: History will load only when `Show history` flag is enabled in the channel settings

## Code snippets for iOS Push notifications


Notifications are sent to Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) service which then pushes them to the app using the user's device. This section provides payloads that are sent to APN for different on-tap actions.

The following table provides descriptions of different parameters in the code snippets:


Parameter | Datatype | Description
------------ | ----- | -----------
title | String | Title of the notification.
body | String | Content of the notification.
payload | String | Additional parameters such as image, botId, deep-link and journeySlug.
botId | String | The bot ID for which the notification has been triggered.
image | String | The path to the image file or a URL of the image.
deeplink | String | URL which redirects the user to a particular page of the iOS application.
journeySlug | String | The name of the journey which has to be triggered in the bot, when the user taps on the notification.
contentAvailable | Boolean | Whether to handle background notifications.

:::note
* Either `deviceToken` or `ymAuthToken` is needed. For campaigns, `deviceToken` is mandatory and `ymAuthToken` is optional. <br/>However, to push notifications from from your app to User 360, only `ymAuthToken` is required.
* Ensure you create users along with their device and ym authentication tokens.
* When sending out notifications, the yellow.ai consumes these details automatically, decides the platform, and sends out notifications accordingly.
:::


### Notification without custom action

This is used to redirect the user to the main activity of the app - On tap action, open the app (your app)]- Step 7 of [Push notification template](/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/templates/mobilepush). 


We do not send any payload, instead, we just trigger the notification containing the title and body along with the image (if included). There is no action included in the payload.

```json
{
 "topic": {bundleId},
 "contentAvailable": true,
 "title": "hey there",
 "body": "description",
 "payload": {
 "image": "{imageUrl}"
 }
}
```


### Notification with Deep-link

This is used for the On tap action to open a deep link to the app - when a user clicks on the notification, it redirects to a specific screen of the app.

The payload consists of the standard notification details (title, body, and image) along with the `botId` and `deeplink` URI.

```json
{
  "topic": "{bundleId}",
  "contentAvailable": true,
  "title": "hey there",
  "body": "description",
  "payload": {
    "image": "{imageUrl}",
    "botId": "{botID}",
    "deeplink": "{url}"
  }
}
```

### Notification with bot response

This is used for the On tap action to open a specific bot flow - when a user clicks on the notification, it opens the bot that can [trigger a specific bot flow](#payload-to-trigger-bot-flow) or [shows a predefined response](#payload-to-open-the-bot-with-a-predefined-response).

#### Payload to trigger bot flow

Here is the payload to trigger a specific bot flow when the user clicks on the notification.

```json
{
  "topic": "{bundleId}",
  "contentAvailable": true,
  "title": "hey there",
  "body": "description",
  "payload": {
    "botId": "{botID}",
    "image": "{imageUrl}",
    "journeySlug": "slug"
  }
}
```

#### Payload to open the bot with a predefined response

Here is the payload to show a specific bot response (text message) when the user clicks on the notification.

It just contains `botId` in the response under the `data` parameter. 

```json
{
  "topic": "{bundleId}",
  "contentAvailable": true,
  "title": "hey there",
  "body": "description",
  "payload": {
    "botId": "{botID}",
    "image": "{imageUrl}",
  }
}
```

## Implementation codes for iOS app developer

### Extract parameters from notifications

Use the following code snippet to define what happens when the user clicks on the notification. You can fetch additional data from the user when the user clicks on the notification.

```js
class NotificationService: UNNotificationServiceExtension { 
  var contentHandler: ((UNNotificationContent) -> Void)? 
  var bestAttemptContent: UNMutableNotificationContent? 

override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) { 
self.contentHandler = contentHandler bestAttemptContent = (request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent)

  let title = request.content.userInfo["title"]; 
  let body = request.content.userInfo["body"]; 
  let payload = request.content.userInfo["payload"]; 
  let botId = request.content.userInfo["payload"]["botId"]; 
  let image = request.content.userInfo["payload"]["image"]; 
  let journeySlug = request.content.userInfo["payload"]["journeySlug"]; 
  }
}
```

### Handle image notifications

Use the following code snippet to handle image notifications.

```js
import UserNotifications 
class NotificationService: UNNotificationServiceExtension { 
   var contentHandler: ((UNNotificationContent) -> Void)? 
   var bestAttemptContent: UNMutableNotificationContent? 

override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) { 
   self.contentHandler = contentHandler bestAttemptContent = (request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent) if let  
   bestAttemptContent = bestAttemptContent { // Modify the notification content here... bestAttemptContent.title = "\(bestAttemptContent.title) [modified]" 
   var urlString:String? = nil if let urlImageString = request.content.userInfo["image"] as? String { 
   urlString = urlImageString 
} 

if urlString != nil, let fileUrl = URL(string: urlString!) { print("fileUrl: \(fileUrl)") 

   guard let imageData = NSData(contentsOf: fileUrl) else { 
     contentHandler(bestAttemptContent) 
     return } 
   
   guard let attachment = UNNotificationAttachment.saveImageToDisk(fileIdentifier: "image.jpg", data: imageData, options: nil) else { 
   print("error in UNNotificationAttachment.saveImageToDisk()") 
   contentHandler(bestAttemptContent) 
   return 
 } 
   bestAttemptContent.attachments = [ attachment ] 
   } 
   contentHandler(bestAttemptContent) 
  } 
} 

override func serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire() { 
// Called just before the extension will be terminated by the system. 
// Use this as an opportunity to deliver your "best attempt" at modified content, otherwise the original push payload will be used. 
if let contentHandler = contentHandler, let bestAttemptContent = bestAttemptContent { 
   contentHandler(bestAttemptContent) 
   } 
  } 
} 

@available(iOSApplicationExtension 10.0, *) 
extension UNNotificationAttachment { 
static func saveImageToDisk(fileIdentifier: String, data: NSData, options: [NSObject : AnyObject]?) -> UNNotificationAttachment? { 
  let fileManager = FileManager.default 
  let folderName = ProcessInfo.processInfo.globallyUniqueString 
  let folderURL = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: NSTemporaryDirectory()).appendingPathComponent(folderName, isDirectory: true) do { 
  try fileManager.createDirectory(at: folderURL!, withIntermediateDirectories: true, attributes: nil) 
  let fileURL = folderURL?.appendingPathComponent(fileIdentifier) 
  try data.write(to: fileURL!, options: []) 
  let attachment = try UNNotificationAttachment(identifier: fileIdentifier, url: fileURL!, options: options) 
  return attachment 
} 
catch let error { 
  print("error \(error)") 
 } 
 return nil 
 } 
}
```

### Push Notifications

YMChat supports firebase notifications. Assign your `FCM token` to deviceToken

```swift
config.deviceToken = "your-firebase-device-token"
```

:::note Mapping Firebase service key against Bot Id
Firebase service account Json file is required to send notifications. You need to map service account json file against your bot ID. Request your contact person from `yellow.ai` to share api for same. For more information about Firebase service account json file and how to get it check link [here](https://developers.google.com/assistant/engagement/notifications#get_a_service_account_key)
:::

### Payload

Additional information can be passed in the form of key value pair from app to bot using payload.

```swift
config.payload = ["name": "ym.bot.name", "device-type": "mobile"]
```

Payload can be used to pass information from host app to bot. The payload dictionary should be JSON compatible else an error will be thrown

For passing data from bot to app refer bot [Bot Events](#bot-events)

:::note payload security
Payload is securely passed in HTTPS post request to protect the information passed in it
:::

#### Trigger journey

A specific journey can be triggered on launch, by passing the slug in the payload.

```swift
config.payload = ["JourneySlug" : "checkout-cart"]
```

### On Premise / Region Specific deployments

Your on-prem deployment URL can be set to `customBaseUrl`

```swift
config.customBaseUrl = "https://yourcustomurl.com"
```

If the bot is deployed in a specific region(e.g. r1,r2,r3..rn) on yellow.ai cloud, set the `customBaseUrl` as follows

```swift
config.customBaseUrl = "https://rx.cloud.yellow.ai"
```
Here rx = r1,r2,r3,r4,r5 etc

### Custom loader

You can customize the loading image while bot loads. Just pass the URL in the following way. It is recommended to use jpg, png, svg or gif

```swift
config.customLoaderUrl = "https://example.com/your/custom/image.gif"
```

### V2 bot

You can enable V2 bot by setting the version in config. Default value is 1

```swift
config.version = 2
```

### Speech to Text

#### Enable Speech
Speech to text can be enabled by setting the enableSpeech flag. Default value is `false`

```swift
config.enableSpeech = true
```

#### Mic Icon Color
You can change the mic button icon color by setting `fabIconColor` in `enableSpeechConfig` of YMConfig.

```swift
config.enableSpeechConfig.fabIconColor = UIColor.white
```

#### Mic Background Color
You can change the mic button bakground color by setting `fabBackgroundColor` in `enableSpeechConfig` of YMConfig.

```swift
config.enableSpeechConfig.fabBackgroundColor = UIColor.blue
```

### Hide Input Bar

You can hide the input bar while bot is loading by setting the disableActionsOnLoad flag present in config. Default value is `false`

```swift
config.disableActionsOnLoad = true
```

### Use Lite version 

You can use lite version of the bot by setting the useLiteVersion flag present in config. Default value is `false`

```swift
config.useLiteVersion = true
```

### Colors

#### Status bar background

Status bar background color can be set using `statusBarColor` variable present in YMConfig

```swift
config.statusBarColor = UIColor.red
```

#### Status bar style

Status bar style can be set on `statusBarStyle` variable present in YMConfig.

Values can be either `default`, `lightContent` or `darkContent`. Default type is `default`

```swift
config.statusBarStyle = UIStatusBarStyle.darkContent
```

#### Close button

Close button color can be set on `closeButtonColor`

```swift
config.closeButtonColor = UIColor.blue
```

## Start chatbot

Once the config is set, chat bot can be presented by calling `startChatbot()` method and passing your view controller as an argument

```swift
do {
    try YMChat.shared.startChatbot(on: self)
} catch {
    print("Error occured while loading chatbot \(error)")
}
```

## Initialise View

`initialiseView()` creates an instance of UIViewController which can be used to show the chat view. This view controller can be presented over an existing view controller or can be pushed in navigation controller.

```swift
do {
   let chatViewController = try YMChat.shared.initialiseView()
   self.navigationController?.pushViewController(chatViewController, animated: true)
} catch {
    print("Error occured while loading chatbot \(error)")
}
```

## Bot Events

Bot events are used to pass information from bot to app. For passing events from app to bot refer [Payload](#payload)

Events from bot can be handled using delegate pattern.

```swift
YMChat.shared.delegate = self
```

Once the delegate is assigned define the `eventResponse(_:)` function. The handler class should conform to `YMChatDelegate`

```swift
func onEventFromBot(_ response: YMBotEventResponse) {
    print("Event received \(response)")
    if response.code == "code-from-bot" {
        print("Even from a bot has been received", response.data)
    }
}
```

#### Bot close event

Bot close event is separetly sent and it can be handled in following way. The handler class should conform to `YMChatDelegate`

```swift
func onBotClose() {
    print("Bot closed")
}
```

## Close bot

Bot can be programatically closed using `closeBot()` function

```swift
YMChat.shared.closeBot()
```
## Reload bot

To reload the bot with the same configuration, use the `reloadBot()` function. This will reload the bot without closing and reopening it.

```java
ymChat.reloadBot();
```

## Register Device

If you want to receiving push notifications without or before launching the bot, you can register your device.
To use this api `apiKey`, `botId`, `deviceToken` and `ymAuthenticationToken` are mandatory parameters.

```swift
    let config = YMConfig(botId: "your bot id")
    config.deviceToken = "your FCM Token"
    config.ymAuthenticationToken = "your ymAuthentication token"

    // Set custom base url in case your bot does not belong to india region and yellow cloud
    // Example- If your bot is in `r5` region custom base url would be `https://r5.cloud.yellow.ai
    // config.customBaseUrl = "https://r5.cloud.yellow.ai"

    YMChat.shared.registerDevice(apiKey: apiKey, ymConfig: config) {
        print("Success")
    } failure: { error in
        print(error)
    }
```

## Unlink Device Token

If you want to stop receiving push notifications you can unlink the device.
To use this api `apiKey`, `botId` and `deviceToken` are mandatory parameters.
Device token typically is unlinked when the user logs out of the app.

```swift
    let config = YMConfig(botId: "your bot id")
    // Set the FCM token as device token, this is required so that it can be removed and customer stop receiving the notification
    config.deviceToken = "your FCM Token"
    // Set custom base url in case your bot does not belong to india region and yellow cloud
    // Example- If your bot is in `r5` or EURO region custom base url would be `https://r5.cloud.yellow.ai
    // config.customBaseUrl = "https://r5.cloud.yellow.ai";

    YMChat.shared.unlinkDeviceToken(apiKey: apiKey, ymConfig: config) {
        print("Token removed successfully")
    } failure: { errorString in
        print("ERROR: \(errorString)")
    }
```

:::note API Key
API key can be generated/found by visiting `https://cloud.yellow.ai` -> Overview -> Configure -> API Key section
:::

## Unread Message Count

If you want to show an indicator in your app if there is any unread messages, you can achieve that by calling the given api when bot is in closed state.
Pre condition to use this api is that customer must have opened the bot at least once with `ymAuthenticationToken` otherwise you will receive an error message.
To use this api `botId` and `ymAuthenticationToken` are mandatory parameters.

```swift
    let config = YMConfig(botId: "your bot id")
    // `ymAuthenticationToken` is required to identify the right
    config.ymAuthenticationToken = "your ymAuthentication token"
    // Set custom base url in case your bot does not belong to india region and yellow cloud
    // Example- If your bot is in `r5` region custom base url would be `https://r5.cloud.yellow.ai
    // config.customBaseUrl = "https://r5.cloud.yellow.ai";

    YMChat.shared.getUnreadMessagesCount(ymConfig: config) { count in
        print("Unread message count:" + count)
    } failure: { error in
        print(error)
    }
```

## Permissions

We are requesting for following permissions

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your microphone will be used to record your speech when you use the Voice feature.</string>
<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>Speech recognition will be used to determine which words you speak into this device&apos;s microphone.</string>
```

:::note Microphone and Speech Permission

Apple's Speech Framework is added in the SDK to support the [Speech to Text](#speech-to-text) feature, and it will only be used when it has been declared in your config.
:::

## Logging

Logging can be enabled to understand the code flow and to fix bugs.

```swift
YMChat.shared.enableLogging = true
```
