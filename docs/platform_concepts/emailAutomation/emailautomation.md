1. **Initial email processing**: Upon receipt of a customer query via email, the Yellow.ai platform takes charge of processing the incoming mail from our inbox.
2. **Intent and entity analysis**: The platform meticulously analyzes the email content to identify key intents and entities, laying the foundation for a targeted response.
3. **Dynamic response generation**:
    - **Flow execution**: The platform dynamically executes predefined flows based on the identified intents and entities, ensuring a tailored approach to customer needs.
    - **FAQ and document integration**: In cases where specific intents or entities don't trigger predefined flows, the system intelligently retrieves responses from our FAQs or uploaded documents.
    - **Thread contextualization**: If the email query is part of an existing thread, the platform intelligently parses the previous conversation to provide contextually relevant responses.
4. **Summarized response generation**: The system consolidates the generated responses and formulates a succinct and coherent output.
5. **Outgoing email response**: The finalized response is formatted and dispatched as an outgoing email to the customer's provided email address.
6. **Human support intervention**: In scenarios where the Yellow.ai platform fails to generate a response, the system seamlessly escalates the query to a human support agent for manual intervention and resolution.
