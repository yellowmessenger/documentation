A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web-based application that allows you to create an app-like experience for users and can be embedded on the web. 

A PWA chatbot is designed to embed on desktops, mobile devices, and other web browsers without the need to download or install any native mobile apps. PWA chatbots are supported on mobile, desktop, and web browsers such as Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

Let's say that you want to build a standalone bot for your brand. You can use a PWA chatbot to provide a convenient and secure conversational experience for the users.
