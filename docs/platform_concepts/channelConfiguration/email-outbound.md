Email is a communication channel through which the organization can interact with users and vice versa. It allows the organization to send campaigns, receive tickets, address support requests, gather feedback, respond to inquiries, or engage in general communication.

When users send an email to the designated email address, the support agents from the organisation will respond to the email accordingly. You can use email for two-way communication to chat with your users. For example, support@organization.com or sales@organization.com.

The following are the different protocols for sending emails:

1. SMTP
2. HTTP-based Email API

### Email SMTP

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a simple mechanism to send or receive emails from or to your mail server. Traditionally, the one-off emails that we send from our mailbox to another are generated by SMTP.

:::note
Use SMTP configuration when the purpose is to send 1:1 transactional/update email notifications through our [Notifications API](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/notification-engine) or [Workflow](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/flows_campaign) campaign, and not usually recommended for bulk promotional ones.
:::

### Web-based Email API

A web-based Email API is a mechanism to exchange emails via HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). It allows you to access the functionality of the email services such as sending and receiving emails, managing contacts and mailboxes, and performing other email-related tasks, within the applications or systems.

### Difference between SMTP and  Email API


|SMTP  | Email API |
|--|--|
| SMTP is a protocol used to transfer emails between servers. The brand’s own SMTP can be used for sending transactional, support, workflow-driven, or one-off emails. | Email API is a set of tools and functions provided by an email service provider to allow you to programmatically interact with their email services. |
|This mechanism is not recommended for sending bulk or promotional email campaigns.| This mechanism can be chosen when the use case is to send bulk emails for promotional goals. |


## Add sender email account 

You can add sender email acount either by configuring the SMTP of the brand’s professional sender email ID or by adding the web-based email API key to the platform. Upon successful configuration, the platform can send emails from the associated Email ID.

### Set up SMTP-based email account (Basic)

This setup allows our platform to send emails on behalf of the email domain. For more information on how to setup Email channel, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/tickets/setupandconfig#1).

To set up SMTP server on the yellow.ai platform, follow these steps:

1. Log on to `https://cloud.yellow.ai` and navigate to **Overview** > **Channels** > **Messaging** > **Email**.

2. Click **Add account**

3. In the *Add Email* section, select **Basic** to add the details of the EMAIL sender.

Enter the following details:

* **Configuration objective**: Select the purpose of the current email account - Campaigns or Support ticketing. You can select both if needed.
  * **Campaigns** - You can choose this option to send the campaigns such as promotions, newsletters and updates, event invitations, and so on. You need to create a [email template](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/templates/email-template) to exceute a campaign. After creating a template, you need create a email campaign. For more information, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/outbound-campaigns/run-campaign#32-email-campaign).
  * **Support ticketing** - You can choose this option  to raise your queries so that agent can track inquiries effectively. Each email received from a user is considered as a ticket. This helps support teams manage and prioritize incoming requests. For more information, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/tickets/tickets_intro).
* **Email**: Enter the email address (sender ID) that you want to associate with the account. For example, support@organization.com.
* **Server**: Enter the host URL. The value will be unique for each mail server. For example, it will be `smtp.gmail.com` for the Gmail server and `smtp.office365.com` for the Outlook server. In some cases, like a private server, the value will be the IP address of the SMTP connector service.
* **Username**: Enter the same email address that you entered in the Email field. For shared accounts such as Microsoft, these could be different.
* **Password**: Enter the app password of the specified email address. To know how to generate and use an app password for each server, see [Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) and [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/using-app-passwords-with-apps-that-don-t-support-two-step-verification-5896ed9b-4263-e681-128a-a6f2979a7944).

:::note
* You should enter the same input for the email ID and username.
* Some email servers like Gmail offers [safer alternatives](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en) to expose the password. You can generate it and provide it while configuring SMTP.
* For more details on SMTP, reach out to your IT team.
:::

* **Port**: Select the preferred port value where you want to establish the SMTP connection. It can be 465, 587, or 25.
:::note
* You need to contact your support team to get the port value.
:::
* **Security type**: Select the appropriate security type - SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security).
* Click **Save**.

:::note
You can only forward messages to a single Gmail address, not an email group or alias.

        "supportTicketing"
    ],
    "address": "customerservice@easyshopping.id",
    "outboundConfig": {
        "server": "outlook.office365.com",
        "port": 587,
        "username": "customerservice@easyshopping.id",
        "name": "Customer Service Easy Shopping",
        "password": "44!88NZk5yK!9@#WUgRh",
        "securityType": "SSL",
        "useAdvanceConfiguration": true,
        "advanceConfiguration": {
            "service": "Outlook365",
            "auth": {
                "user": "customerservice@easyshopping.id",
                "pass": "44!88NZk5yK!9@#WUgRh"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

:::note
* To send mail on behalf of the client, the client should enable SMTP authentication.
* In cases where clients have disabled SMTP auth for security reasons, they can whitelist Yellow.ai’s IP and allow emails from that IP.
* For Yellow.ai to receive emails from the customers of the client, the client needs to configure a unique forwarding address provided by Yellow.ai after configuring an email on the Channels page.

### Get your Outlook SMTP

To get Outlook SMTP, follow these steps in Outlook:

1. Navigate to the **File** menu.  
2. Click Info. Go to the **Account Settings** page.
3. On the Yellow.ai platform, look for the email address that you want to configure.  
4. Search for the **Outgoing server field**.  
   * You will see the SMTP that you want.   


### Get your Gmail SMTP

For emails to be sent from smtp.gmail.com, make sure you have followed these 2 steps:
