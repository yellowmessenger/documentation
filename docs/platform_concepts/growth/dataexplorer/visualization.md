Using charts, graphs, dashboards, and other visualizations is an effective way to make your data more accessible and engaging in real-world discussions. 

## 1. Apply visualisation on a summarized table

Before creating visualizations, you must **summarize** the data in tables. After that, you can then create visualizations using the summarized tables by following the steps below.

1. On the query page, click **Visualisation**.

#### Choosing the right chart for visualisation 

- **Line Chart**: A line chart is suitable for visualizing trends over time. It could be used to display changes in a variable, such as stock prices of a company, over a period of time.
- **Bar Chart**: A bar chart is effective in comparing data across different categories. It could be used to compare the sales of various products in a store.
- **Row Chart**: Similar to a bar chart, a row chart can be used to compare data across categories, but with horizontal bars instead of vertical ones. It is ideal when category labels are long, such as comparing performance of different departments in a company.
- **Funnel Chart**: A funnel chart is useful for showing the progression of data through different stages. It could be used to display the conversion rate of website visitors to leads, leads to prospects, and prospects to customers.
- **Count Chart**: A count chart is great for displaying the frequency of values in a dataset. It could be used to show how frequently each letter appears in a block of text.
- **Pie Chart**: A pie chart is an excellent choice for representing how a whole is divided into parts. It could be used to illustrate the proportion of expenses in a household budget.
