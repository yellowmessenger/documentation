## Limitations of CleverTap integration

The CleverTap integration does not support the following: 
1. The text in a header cannot be dynamically changed.
2. Media formats supported within the header are png, jpg and mp4.
3. Error codes in callbacks from the WA server.
4. Dynamic quick replies.


## CleverTap Integration process

To integrate Yellow.ai with CleverTap, follow these steps - 

1. On the Cloud platform, navigate to Development/Staging environment and go to **Extensions** > **Integrations** > **Tools & Utilities** > **CleverTap**. Alternatively, you can use the Search box to find a specific integration.

2. Generate and copy the API key and paste it with in the Authorization header over on CleverTap. 
3. Enable Postback URL from Preferences in Engage. To know how to enable this from Preferences, see [Notification Engine](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/notification-engine#14-send-delivery-status-to-webhook).
4. Paste the callback URL generated by CleverTap in the fields shown on the integrations page.

5. Register https://cloud.yellow.ai/integrations/genericIntegration/clevertap as a static URL on the CleverTap dashboard to trigger Yellow.ai campaigns. 
6. Generate regular templates through the [Template creation module](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/templates/overview) and use those template names directly in CleverTap.
7. To dynamically change text within a template, you can make use of **Freeform templates**. These will help you to pass dynamic text on CleverTap. For this, you need to generate two separate templates.

   i. **Freeform text template**: This is a template with just a variable `{{1}}`. Once approved, you can pass the template as a field within the Integrations page.

   ii. **Freeform media template**: This follows the same behaviour of the text template but with a media file attached at the time of approval. You can change the media dynamically changed over on CleverTap.

8. Once the templates are approved, pass both of these template names into the integration page fields.

10. If you have multiple accounts, Click **+ Add account** and follow the above mentioned steps to add each of them. 2. You can add a maximum of 15 accounts.


:::note
1. Enter a unique name for each account to easily identify them within the yellow.ai platform. It is recommended to use a name that aligns with its purpose for better usability. 
3. In a two-tier environment, such as bots with only Development/Live environments, you can add account names only in the development mode. Once added and flows have been built, in the Live mode, you can only choose the account names and not edit them.
4. In a three-tier environment, such as bots with Staging/Sandbox/Production modes, in Staging and Sandbox modes, you can add and edit new accounts. However, in Production, only the account details added in Staging will be available. You can only map in the production environment.
