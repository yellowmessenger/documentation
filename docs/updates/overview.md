## Knowledgebase

### Conversational Knowledge Base (KB) **![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Enhancement-ff9800)**

We have intoduced Conversational KB, a smarter and more intuitive way to deliver knowledge-driven conversations in your AI agents!

**What is Conversational KB?**

Conversational KB is an intelligent AI-powered knowledge assistant that enables your AI agent to understand user intent, retain conversation context, and respond in a more human-like, interactive manner when answering queries from your knowledge base.

**What’s new?**

**Before:**

* KB responses were static, one-shot Q&A interactions.
* No context retention across user messages.
* Complex KB setup involving multiple methods (DC nodes, KB skills, prompt engineering, custom functions).
* Creating a conversational experience often required writing dozens of lines of prompt code and debugging issues in the setup.

**Now:**

* Unified and simplified KB setup: One clean interface to configure search instructions.
* Prompt complexity drastically reduced. Example: Recreating the Enbridge bot previously needed 74 lines of prompt code in a DC node. With Conversational KB, it now takes just 20 lines — cutting down time, effort, and complexity significantly.

**Key features**

* **Smarter conversations**: The agent can ask follow-up questions, clarifying questions and follow up with users, creating a much more natural, interactive experience..
* **Context retention:** It remembers what the user previously asked, enabling smoother, context-aware interactions without repetition.
* **Rich media responses**: Enhance answers with images and videos as part of the KB response.
* **Multi-step reasoning over retrieved content**: Agent can reason over the retrieved content, before sharing the final response
* **Multilingual support**: The AI agent can automatically respond in the user’s language.
* **Clickable hyperlinks**: Any links in responses are now displayed as hyperlinks.

## Agent AI

### Automate Revamp: A Simpler, Smarter Way to Build Gen AI Agents **![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Enhancement-ff9800)**

We’ve reimagined the AI agent setup experience to be more guided, efficient, and powerful—so you spend less time configuring and more time delivering intelligent conversations.



#### **What’s enhanced:**

#### Simplified Setup

Define your AI agent’s behavior using natural language. Just describe what the agent should do, and the system generates the logic for you—no technical configuration required.


#### Super Agents & Agents

Design large, multi-functional AI assistants with ease using a modular architecture.

   ![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/superagent.png)

* **Super Agent:** Acts as the master controller that defines your AI assistant’s overarching goal (e.g., customer support, travel, healthcare). It intelligently routes queries to the right sub-agent and manages the overall conversation flow.
* **Agents:** Independent, task-specific AI agents under the Super Agent. Each one handles a focused use case such as booking a flight, cancelling a ticket, or responding to knowledge-based queries. This structure keeps logic clean, reusable, and scalable.


#### Improved Conversation Design

Build smarter, more natural conversations using intuitive building blocks:

* **Start Triggers:** Automatically detect user intent and launch the right conversation.
* **Prompts:** Ask relevant questions, deliver precise answers, and guide users clearly.
* **Actions:** Perform tasks like capturing inputs, calling APIs, or handling fallback responses.
* **Variables:** Store, recall, and reuse user data throughout the interaction for a personalized experience.
* **Workflows:** Seamlessly connect to external systems and dynamically fetch or update data in real time.

### PCI-Compliant Data Capture Now Supported in Question Nodes
As part of our ongoing commitment to security and compliance, Yellow.ai now supports PCI-compliant data capture across multiple channels using question nodes, in addition to the previously supported voice input nodes. You can then use the API node to transfer PCI-sensitive information securely.

#### Key enhancements

* **PCI Classification for Inputs**
   Specific input fields—such as card number, CVV, PIN, and expiry—can now be marked as PCI data. Once classified, these inputs are automatically encrypted, logged securely, and handled per PCI DSS guidelines.
* **Multi-Channel Support**
   PCI input is now supported in question nodes, enabling secure data collection across Web, WhatsApp, and Voice channels.
* **API-Only Access for PCI Variables**
   PCI variables are securely stored and cannot be accessed via function or code nodes. They are available only through the API node. 
   <br/>
   PCI variables can be accessed only once via the API node. After a successful API call, the associated PCI data is securely deleted and can no longer be retrieved. This ensures sensitive information is never stored longer than necessary, maintaining strict compliance with PCI standards.

## Insights


### Sunset Notice: Clearing the Path for a Smarter Analytics Experience **![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Enhancement-ff9800)**

As we prepare for a major revamp of our Analytics module, we’re streamlining the experience by removing a few legacy screens over the next two weeks. These updates are part of our broader effort to deliver cleaner insights, modern visualizations, and a more intuitive interface.

Here’s what’s changing:


#### Insights – User Journeys

With the shift towards agentic AI workflows, this section—based on an older implementation—no longer aligns with our direction. We’re removing it, but don’t worry:

* **Top Flows Visited** and
* **Journey Completion Rate** (will still be available in the **Overview** dashboard)

   ![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/userjourney.png)

#### Insights – Health

This screen is being taken down temporarily. In its place, we’re working on a refreshed **Alerts** tab to provide a more actionable view into bot performance and system health—coming soon.

   ![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/alerts.png)

#### Engage – User Data & User Trends

These screens haven’t seen active usage since January 2025 and aren’t tied to core workflows. To reduce clutter and focus on what matters, we’re phasing them out.

   ![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/user-data.png)


#### What’s Next?

We’re reimagining Analytics to support faster decision-making with smarter, cleaner, and more relevant insights. Stay tuned for upcoming releases with exciting upgrades.
