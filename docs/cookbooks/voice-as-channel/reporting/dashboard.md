The voice bot overview dashboard is built on top of the CDR data and tracks valuable metrics in a more visual and intuitive manner for effective reporting.
The Voice Overview Dashboard includes the following key metrics:
1. User traffic metrics such as calls and duration
2. Analysis of call statuses

Examples of insights you can derive from the dashboard:
- Retrieve the total number of calls received in the past week.
- Retrieve the average duration of calls for the previous 30 days.
- Retrieve the answering rate for the outbound campaign during the last quarter.
