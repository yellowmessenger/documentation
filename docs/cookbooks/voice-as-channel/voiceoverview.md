## <a name="intro"></a> 1. Introduction to conversational voice AI

To begin with, let's understand Conversational AI before delving into its subset, Conversational Voice AI.

### 1.1 What is conversational AI?

Conversational AI, short for Conversational Artificial Intelligence, refers to the utilization of technology and algorithms to create lifelike dialogues and interactions between humans and machines. By incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and other related technologies, chatbots, virtual assistants, and other automated systems can communicate with users in a way that is natural and intuitive, similar to how humans converse with one another.

To comprehend user input, conversational AI systems employ various techniques such as speech recognition, text analysis, and semantic understanding, and can tailor their responses to meet the user's needs and business preferences. These systems have a wide range of applications, from customer service and healthcare to education and entertainment, providing personalized support, answering questions, and automating mundane tasks.

### 1.2 What is conversational voice AI

Conversational AI is an extensive domain that encompasses diverse channels and technologies. One of its significant subsets is Conversational Voice AI, which focuses specifically on voice-based interactions between machines and humans. It leverages Speech Recognition technologies and Speech Synthesis alongside NLP to enable users to interact with devices and software using natural language or voice commands instead of traditional input methods like typing or clicking.

Conversational Voice AI systems employ speech recognition technologies to convert spoken words into text, enabling NLP algorithms to understand their meaning and provide an appropriate response that can be converted back into voice or audio using speech synthesis. These systems can be integrated into various devices and platforms, including smart speakers, IVR assistants, mobile apps, and cars.

Overall, Conversational Voice AI holds immense potential to improve accessibility and convenience for users, making it easier for them to interact with technology more naturally and intuitively. It can revolutionize the way users interact with devices and software, leading to enhanced user satisfaction and a better user experience.

### 1.3 Adapting to customer needs with voice bots

In today's fast-paced world, customer preferences evolve rapidly, and businesses must keep up to stay ahead of the competition and meet their customers' changing needs. Customers increasingly prefer automated self-service options like mobile applications or business chatbot setups to address simple concerns, such as updating personal account details or canceling an order.

While the popularity of automated self-service options is nothing new, customers now seek even more convenience by resolving their queries through voice commands. This is where voice bots come in, providing the ease and convenience customers crave for resolving their queries.

To assist businesses in providing better virtual assistants, Yellow offers voice bots that can help them meet their customers' needs effectively.

## <a name="fundamentals"></a> 2. Deploying and understanding voice bots for business


Yellow AI offers top-notch voice bots that can be easily integrated with a business's phone lines. These bots simulate human-like conversations and can perform various tasks, including answering questions, providing information, and completing transactions.

With voice bots in place, customers can dial a business's phone number and receive quick and convenient solutions to their simpler queries. Additionally, businesses can leverage outbound campaigns via phone calls to reach out to their target audience for tasks such as collecting product feedback, verifying user data, and reminding users of payment deadlines.

Here's how voice bots work end-to-end:

1. The **automatic speech recognition** system listens to the caller's request and transforms it into text.
2. The **natural language understanding** component comprehends the speaker's intent and identifies relevant information to drive the conversation forward.
3. The **conversation module**, or business logic, determines the appropriate response by considering the user's request's context.
4. Advanced **text-to-speech** technology converts the response text into human-like speech.
5. Voice bots continually improve their ability to simulate human conversations by analyzing user data and adding it to their knowledge database using advanced **machine learning** features.
