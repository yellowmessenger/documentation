Brands can configure hyperlinks that redirect users to phone apps or email services in various components like Text Messages, Quick Replies (QRs), Cards, and Callout Banners. 

To set up these links:

1. For phone numbers, add tel:+{phone_number} to the button link. For example, tel:+919988776655 will initiate a call when the button is clicked.
2. For emails, add mailto:{email ID} to the button link. For example, mailto:apps@yellow.ai will open the default email client when the button is clicked.
