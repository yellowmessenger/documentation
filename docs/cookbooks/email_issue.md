If you're not receiving emails from the Yellow\.ai platform, follow the steps below to identify and resolve the issue.


### Step 1: Check if the Issue Is Isolated

Determine whether the issue is specific to you or affecting others in your organization.

* Ask colleagues if they are receiving Yellow\.ai emails.
* If only you are affected, proceed to the next steps.

---

### Step 2: Check Your Spam or Junk Folder

Emails may be incorrectly flagged by your email client.

* Review your **Spam**, **Junk**, or **Promotions** folders.
* If you find Yellow\.ai emails there, mark them as **Not Spam** to prevent future filtering.

### Step 3: Try a Different Network

Some networks may restrict or block certain emails.

* Switch from your work network to **mobile data** or **home Wi-Fi**.
* Check if emails arrive when connected to a different network.

---

### Step 4: Verify with Your IT or Security Team

If the issue persists across networks, contact your IT or security team to confirm:

* Whether **firewall rules or email security filters** are blocking messages from Yellow\.ai.
* If **Yellow\.ai’s email IP addresses** are whitelisted.

  > You can request the IP list by emailing [support@yellow.ai](mailto:support@yellow.ai).
