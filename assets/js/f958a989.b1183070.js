This comprehensive guide will walk you through the powerful RESTful API provided by Yellow.ai. With our API, you can seamlessly create and manage user data, retrieve user details, update user information, and unlock a host of other functionalities. Our API is designed to offer flexibility and simplicity, while prioritizing the security and integrity of your user data.\n\n## Overview\n\nYellow.ai offers a robust RESTful API that empowers you to manage user data, user events, outbound notifications, email ticketing, and more. Our API is designed to provide a seamless experience, offering flexibility and simplicity in its usage. We prioritize the security and integrity of your user data, ensuring that it remains protected throughout your interactions with our API. Leverage our powerful API to streamline your workflows and enhance your user management capabilities.\n\n ## Authentication\n Yellow.ai APIs support OAuth for authentication. To generate an authentication token, follow these steps:\n\n 1. Ensure that you have super admin privileges for the bot.\n 2. Access the Yellow.ai platform and navigate to the bot for which you want to generate the authentication token.\n 3. In the bot settings or administration section, locate the option for generating an authentication token. The exact location may vary depending on the Yellow.ai platform version you are using.\n 4. Click on the "Generate Token" or similar button to initiate the token generation process.\n 5. You may be prompted to provide additional information or permissions for the token generation. Follow the on-screen instructions and provide the necessary details.\n 6. Once the process is complete, the Yellow.ai platform will generate an authentication token for you.\n 7. Safely store the authentication token as it will be required for making authenticated API requests to Yellow.ai APIs.\n 8. Include the authentication token in the request headers of your API calls. Typically, you would add an `Authorization` header with the value "Bearer <authentication_token>".\n 9. Please note that the generated authentication token provides access to the APIs based on the permissions and privileges associated with your super admin account. Handle the token with caution.\n\n## Generate API Keys\n\n\n API keys act as secure passcodes, granting authorized access to specific functionalities or resources within a system. They serve as an additional layer of protection, safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring that only authenticated users or applications can interact with the API.\n \n * Only Admins and Super Admins of the bot can create API keys with different roles.\n * Key creators or Super Admins can delete keys. Super admin can delete any key, regardless of the creator.\n\n\n To generate an API key, follow these steps:\n\n 1. On the bot Overview page, go to **Access Control** > **API Keys**.\n\n ![](https://i.imgur.com/6L7qEaO.png)\n\n 2. To create a new API Key, click **Generate new API key**.\n 3. Name the API key in **API Name** and select **User role** from the dropdown.\n\n <img src="https://i.imgur.com/UUCmfG1.png" width="40%"/>\n\n 4. If necessary, add whitelist IP to ensure smooth access, especially if the IP is at risk of being blocked by the firewall.\n 5. Click **Save** to generate the API key.\n 6. Copy the generated key and use it in your API calls wherever required.\n\n ![](https://i.imgur.com/VcDUuHe.png)\n',slug:"/introduction",frontMatter:{},info:{title:"Yellow.ai APIs",version:"1.0",description:'## API Documentation: Yellow.ai\n\nWelcome to the API documentation for Yellow.ai!
