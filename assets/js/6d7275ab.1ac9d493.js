For user-replaceable batteries, suggest, "Make sure they are replaced every 6 months."\n\nIf even after replacing the batteries or charging the mouse the issue persists, go to STEP 11.\n\nSTEP 11: Check if the mouse works with an alternate laptop or computer\nAsk, "Can you try the complete mouse setup with an alternate laptop or computer? If it works with the alternate computer setup, then the issue may be related to the mouse driver file on the personal computer."\n\nIf it works with the alternate laptop or computer, go to STEP 12. If not, go to STEP 13.\n\nSTEP 12: Share the link to the new driver file for the mouse via SMS\nMention, "I will send you a link to the updated driver file via SMS.
